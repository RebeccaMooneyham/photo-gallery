# photo-gallery
Treehouse Techdegree project: Photo Gallery. I created an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery. The layout was coded and designed from scratch using HTML and CSS. I incorporated a lightbox feature using jQuery to showcase selected works. I also wrote JavaScript code to implement search box functionality.
